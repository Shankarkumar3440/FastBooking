                        Online Bus Booking System is a web-based application that works within a centralized network. It provides 
                        facilities to reserve seats and offers different types of inquiries that require instant and quick reservation. 
                        Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or 
                        tourism. Promotional buses may be used for political campaigns, and others are privately operated for a wide 
                        range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles.
